# BinaryClassification

This project analyzes different classifcation techniques in a binary task. The goal here is to discriminate between good and bad
quality wines.

The different classifiers analyzed in this project are:
- MultiVariate Gaussian classifier
- Linear Regression classifier
- Support Vector Machines
- Gaussian Mixture Models

The task is divided into tree stages:
1. The training set is studied to investigate the relationships between features and labels of the training set. 
2. The different classifiers are trained and their performance on the validation set is compared. In this step model parameters and hyperparameters have been computed.
3. The final step consists in considering the performances obtained on the test set to assess the goodness of taken decisions.
